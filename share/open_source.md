# Contribute to Opensource
In the read section, we talked about why it's so important to read other's code. In last chapter, we talked how you can contribute to open through google summer of code if you are a student. But what if you are not a student and want to contribute to open source in freetime?

This chapter we talk about how you can contribute to open source through various ways.

#Choosing a project
Many of the people who talk to ask me how to choose a project to start contributing. I normally answer "whichever you use the most". It is always good to choose a project you normally use in your work. It may be a Javascript library, Java library or framework. The reason being that you will be highly familiar with the project so it will be easy for you start thinking how you can improve the project which inturn improves your work.


#Code is not only way to contribute
There is a misconception with people that contributing to open source means just contributing code. Though contributing code may be great, but its not only way to contribute the open source. There are many ways you contribute beside the code.

The following are few ways you can contribute to the project

* ###Answer in mailing lists

As you become more familiar with project, you will be more experienced in how to use the tool or library. In mailing lists, lot of people will be in the need of that expertise. So to start with you can start answering questions in mailing list. This improves the people's understanding of the project and inturn more people will be willing to use.

So answering in the mailing list be one of the good place to start with.

* ### File bugs

Every software written with humans are buggy. So if you come across some bug in the library don't keep quiet. Raise a bug in apporpriate bug database so that developers of the project knows about it. By filing the bug you are making project better.

* ### Improve the documentation

Not every project comes with great documentation. After using it for sometime you may feel the documentation in not adequete or it's date. Documentation is perfect chance to contribute in open source project. Start improving documentation and suddenly all the people using the project will be beniffited.


* ### Write test cases

Test cases are the best place to start contributing the code to a project. Writing test cases improves you are understanding of the project and also it will help developers of the project to find out the corner cases they may be not considered.

* ### Fix bugs

After getting experienced in the project, you may know lot about how given library works. Also you may filed few bugs yourself. Now if you think you can fix the bugs go ahead and fix it.

* ### Contribute new features

This is the ultimate contribution you want to do. Putting a new feature in a well established project not easy. But after going through all above contribution you should be able to do it.


There are many ways you can contribute to your faviroute project. Go ahead and make a mark.
