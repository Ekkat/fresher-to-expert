# Blog

A blog is an online personal journal or diary. It is a place to express yourself to the world. A place to share your thoughts and your passions. 

A good blog not only helps the author, but it also helps it's readers to improve their knowledge. Writing blogs seems to be easy in first sight, but when you do its not that easy.

### Writing is hard
Writing is a different art when compared to talking. Talking comes natural to humans, but not writing. Writing is something we have cultivated as a culture. So when I ask some developer to talk about what they are doing, they can happily  talk for hours. But if I ask them to write down what they have done, then they  have hard time doing it. This is one of the main reasons for lack of documenation for most of the software tools.

Writing needs a focused manner of expressing your understanding to a fellow person. A good blog always wins its audience by its simplicity and precise explanation to the point. So blogging not only keeps track of your work, but also teaches you how to express your understanding to the world  in a better way.

### Writing as communication tool at workplace
In any profession, at its core, writing is communication, where you have to write documents to express your ideas to your clients and  write mails to express your ideas to higher management. Blogging will not force you to become a better writer, itâ€™ll just happen as you do it.
