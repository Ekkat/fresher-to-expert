# Reading devices
From last chapter we know that why reading books are important and it's very clear that reading is integral part of the developer life. So, In this section we are going to focus on dedicated devices which help you to read better and more.

### Ebook Revolution

Ebooks have revolutionized the way we read. E-reading has lot of advantages over traditional reading in terms of delivery and pricing. So most of your reading will be happening in computer/phone rather than on a traditional book. Being an e-reader has few advantages over traditional way of reading.

* You can read anywhere as and when you want!
* Easy to store thousands of books
* Cheaper than physical copies

But e-reading also comes with additional challenge as laptops or Phones are not well suited for reading books for long time. On phone, the screen size is too small to do any kind of serious reading and on laptop, its difficult to hold it for long time and having keyboard makes it cumbersome.

So having a dedicated device for reading is always great. You may not have to invest immediately as you can do most of the reading through computer or phone. Incase, you are a serious reader give a consideration to reading devices.

The following are few of the devices which gives you a superior reading experience when compared to phone or computer.

### Amazon Kindle
Amazon is a biggest retailer of e-books in the world. Amazon kindle is a dedicated ebook reader which allows you to store and read thousands of books or magazines and it's light and portable. The basic version of Kindle comes with E-ink display which has battery life that lasts over 30 days.Other advantages are that it is easy on eyes and allows you to read in any position when you are reading for longer period of time.

Every thing comes with its own pros and cons!.The con of the kindle is that, its only for  dedicated reading. You cannot do much with kindle other than reading. It's ok for an avid reader. But for majority of developers, other than just reading they also want to access the web, apps like feedly which makes reading complete.

### Tablet
For most of the casual readers, a tablet is much more useful than a kindle device. Tablet normally sports a screen from 7-10 inch touch screen display. Having a bigger screen gives a pleasant reading experience and also gives you better battery life.

In market, there are tablets running on differnt platforms like iOS,android,windows etc from various manufacturers. The tablets running on iOS are called as iPad .

### iPad
I have recommended an Android phone in Smart phone section as it allows developer to be  much more productive. But in tablet section I recommend iPad over any android tablet. The following are few reasons

 * iPad has better apps for reading and learning
 * Extremely good battery life and durability
 * Very light weight

The app ecosystem of iPad is in much more improved state compared to android tablets. So if you are planning to invest money on dedicated reading devices for serious reading I recommend iPad.

### Apps
There are great apps available for reading on android and iOS platforms . The following are few apps which integrate well with web, and makes reading seamless across devices.

* iBooks - Book reader from Apple
* Amazon kindle - Kindle book reader
* Google play books - Sync reading between Android,Web and iPad
* Feedly
* Google apps like Gmail,Google Search, Google maps etc

Reading on iPad or kindle is much more pleasant and satisfying compared to Laptop or phone. So if you want to take your reading to next level, own a dedicated reading device!.
