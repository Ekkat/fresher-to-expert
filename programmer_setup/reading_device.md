# Reading device
From last few chapters, It's been clear that reading is integral part of the developer life. So In this section we are going to focus on dedicated devices which help you to read better and more.

#Ebook Revolution

Ebooks have revolutionized the way we read. Ebooks have lot of advantages over phyzical books interms of deilvery and pricing. So most of your reading will be happening in computer/phone rather than a phyzical book. Being in ebook world has few advantages over phyzical books.

* You can read anywhere you want like on your phone
* Easy to store thousands of Books
* Cheaper than phyzical copies

But reading Ebook also comes with additional challenge. On computer or Phone they are not well suited for reading a book for long time. In the case phone the  the screen size too small to do any kind of serious reading. On a laptop, its difficult to hold for long time and having keyboard makes it cubersome.

So having a dedicated devices for reading is always great. You may not have to invest immediately as you can get by most of the time through computer or phone. But if you seriously want to read a lot give a consideration to the following devices.

The following are few of the devices have superior reading experience compare to phone or a computer.

#Amazon Kindle
Amazon is a biggest retailer of Ebooks in the world. Amazon kindle is a dedicated ebook reader which allow you to store thousands of books and carray with you where you go. The basic version of Kindle comes with E-ink display which last battery for 30 days. It's also easy on eyes which is good for long time reading.

Only con of the kindle, its a dedicated reader. You cannot do much with kindle other than reading. It's ok for an avid reader. But for majority of developers, other than just reading they also want to access the web, apps like feedly which makes reading complete.

#Tablet
For most of casual reader, a tablet is much more useful than a kindle device. Tablet normally sports from 7-10 inch touch screen display. Having a bigger screen makes a pleaseant reading experience and also gives you better battery life.

In market, you find tablets running iOS called as iPad and running Android from Samsung,ASUS and other companies.

#iPad
I have recommended an Android phone in Smartphone section as it allows developer to much more productive. But in tablet section I recommend iPad over any android tablet. The following are few reasons

 * iPad has better apps for reading and learning
 * Extermely good battery life and durablity
 * Very light weight

The app ecosystem of iPad is much more improved state compared to android tablets. So if your are planning to invest in any serious money on dedictated reading devices I recommend going with an iPad.

#Apps
iPad has some great apps for reading and other. The following are few apps which integrate well with web, android phone and iPad which makes reading seemeless across devices.

* iBooks - Book reader from Apple
* Amazon kindle - Kindle book reader
* Google play books - Sync reading between Android,Web and iPad
* Feedly
* Google apps like Gmail,Google Search, Google maps etc

Reading on iPad or kindle is much more pleaseant and satisfying compared to Laptop or phone. So if you want to take you reading to next level buy a dedicated reading device.
