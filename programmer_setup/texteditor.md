# Code editor
Code editor is very important software, every developer has to be a master in it. If you observe life of a developer carefully, most of his time is spent in writing or reading source code in a code editor. So being efficient in code editor saves lot of time for a developer.

This section we are going to look at different code editors you can use. Pick any one to start with and master it.

#Vi and emacs
Vi and emacs are two most famous keyboard-only code editors. These editors are 40 years old, still they are used by millions of developer everyday. What makes so old software to be so useful and why a modern developer like you want to learn?

Following are few reasons which will enforce you to give vi and emacs a shot

* ###Ubiquitos

    You can find vi and emacs on almost every distribution of Linux , Unix and Solaris. These come pre-installed in OS which means you don't have to install anything to use them.This ubiquitous nature becomes important when you are accessing remote machines where you may want to update scripts or some other files. In remote machine, you may not have ability to install new software. So if you are comfortable using vi or emacs you don't need to worry as most probably they are going to be there for you.

* ###Keyboard only

    vi and emacs can be used with only keyboard. All kind of operations like saving a file, moving between lines, selecting text etc can be done with keyboard. Many beginners think it's a deficiency. But its not deficiency. It's a feature.


Most of the computer users who use computer UI to make things simple. As a developer you have to do rapid text editing and code refactoring for which gui becomes cumbersome to use. Each time when you lift your hand from keyboard, it makes you think where to click now. So being only on keyboard not only makes you faster in typing, it also makes use of your muscle memory to do all the boring work of save, compile and refactoring.

* ### Extensible

    Both vi and emacs allows you to extend the editor with plugins. There are thousands of plugins available which allows you to do syntax highlighting, code compilation, debugging and lot more from the editor itself without leaving your keyboard. Now that's the power.If you are really adventures you can even read your email in these editors.

Both of vi and emacs have a steep learning curve and looks too old initially for getting started. But don't be fooled by looks. For developers like us performance matters more than beauty.

#[SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
What if you want all power of vi and emacs but with nice GUI and project management. Then you should give SublimeText a try.

SublimeText is clone of Textmate which is a superb editor of Mac. Sublime is available for Windows,Linux and Mac.SublimeText allows you to do editing of many languages like Java, JS,HTML. It's comes with great UI and very lightweight.

Sublime is free to try forever and when you are happy with the editor you can buy the editor so you support the developer.

This book is written using sublime text.

The other editors you can try are [atom](https://atom.io/),[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) etc.

#IDE
All the above mentioned tools are focused mostly on code editing and reading. What if you want an integrated environment where you can

* Edit
* Compile
* Build
* Debug
* Project Management
* Source code management
* Refactor

then you can use an IDE.

IDE stands for Integrated developer environment. It's a software which allows you to do all the above tasks in one place. Though IDE are more powerful than normal code editors, they consume lot of resources and make you slow as they come with lots  of options.

The following are few options for IDE

* ###[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)

Eclipse is an open source IDE developed by IBM and now maintained by Eclipse.org. Eclipse support multiple languages like Java,C, C++ etc. You can extend eclipse by installing plugins which allows you to build, source code management etc.

* ###[IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

IDEA is primarily a Java IDE. Though you can use eclipse for Java development IDEA has few advantages over eclipse. One of the advantages is memory usage. Eclipse is a memory hog. But IDEA is very lite on memory. This makes IDEA extremely fast to use.


Mastering a Code editor or IDE is extremely important for a developer. So try all the above mentioned tools and settle with the one you like. Once you settle you are going to spend rest of your life to master it in the process of becoming highly productive at work.
