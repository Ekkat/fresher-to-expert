# Code editor
Code editor is very important piece of software a developer has master. If you observe life of a developer carefully, most of his time is spent in writing or reading source code in a code editor. So being efficient in code editor saves a lot of time overtime.

This section we are going to look different code editors you can use. Pick any one to start with and master it.

#Vi and emacs
Vi and emacs are two most famous keyboard-only code editors. These editors are 40 years old, still they are used by millions of developer everyday. What makes so old software to be so useful and why a modern developer like you want to learn?

The following are few of the reason you should give vi and emacs a shot

* ###Ubiquitos

    You can find vi and emacs on almost every distrubution of Linux , Unix,Solaris. These come pre-installed in OS which means you don't have install to anything to use them.This ubiquitos nature becomes important when you are accessing remote machines where you may want to update scripts or some other files. In remote machine, you may not have ability to install new software. So if you are comfortable using vi or emacs you don't need to worry as most probably they are going to be there for you.

* ###Keyboard only

    vi and emacs can be used with only keyboard. All saving, moving between line, selecting text all done with keyboard. Many beginners think it's a deficiency. But its not deficiency. It's a feature.


Most of the users who use computer use UI to make things simple. But as you have to do rapidly text editing and refactoring of code gui becomes more cubersome to use. Each time you have to lift your hand from keyboard makes you think where to click now. So being only on keyboard not only makes you faster in typing, it also makes use of your muscle memory to do all the boring work of save, compile or refactoring.

* ### Extensible

    Both vi and emacs allow you to extend the editor with plugins. There are thousands of plugins avaible which allows you to do syntax highlighting, code compilation, debugging everything from the editor itself. All without ever leaving your keyboard. Now that's the power.If you really adventures you can even read your email in these editors.

Both of vi and emacs have a steep learning curve and looks too old to worth spending time. But don't fooled by looks. For developers like us beauty don't matter but performs matter.

#SublimeText
What if you want all power of vi and emacs but with nice GUI and project managmenet. Then you should give SublimeText a try.

SublimeText is clone of Textmate which is a superb editor of Mac. Sublime is available for Windows,Linux and Mac.SublimeText allows you to do editing of many langauges like Java, JS,HTML. It's comes with great UI and very lightweight.

Sublime is free to try forever and when you are happy with the editor you can buy the editor so you support the developer.

This book is written using sublime text.

The other editors you can try are atom,Notepad++ etc.

#IDE
All the above mentioned tools are focused mostly on code editing and reading. What if you want an integrated environment where you can

* Edit
* Compile
* Build
* Debug
* Project Management
* Source code management
* Refactor

then you can use an IDE.

IDE stands for Integrated developer environment. It's a software which allows you do all the above mentioned things in one place. Though IDE are more powerful than noraml code editors, they consume lot of resources and make you slow as they come with pelothra of options.

The following are few options for IDE

* ###Eclipse

Eclipse is an opensource IDE developed by IBM and now maintained by Eclipse.org. Eclipse support multiple languages like Java,C, C++ etc. You can extend eclipse by installing plugins which allows you to build, source code management etc.

* ###IDEA

IDEA is primarly a Java IDE. Though you can eclipse for Java developement IDEA has few advantages over eclipse. One of the advantages is memory usage. Eclipse is a memory hog. But IDEA is very lite on memory. This makes IDEA exteremly fast use.


Master a Code editor or IDE is extermely important for a developer. So try all the above mentioned tools and settle with one you like. Once you settled you are going to spend rest of life to master and in the process being highly productive.
