# Learn the craft

Last two sections concentrated on the improving skills through by reading other's code, books and blogs. Reading is greate but not enough. Untill you code yourself and see the things by your own eye it will be not completely understood.

In this section, I am going to answer one of the common questions asked by many of just out of college professionals. "How the things I learnt in college relate to the real world problems?".

This section contains resource to build things from scratch. There will be books,courses and other resources which take to step by step building things.

These resources assume you know atleast one computer programming language, know how to use cmd line, datastructures and some basic knowledge of basics of algorithm. These resources long time to master so take time and use them. If you use all of the resources in the chapter you will be more comfortable with your theoratical knowledge.
