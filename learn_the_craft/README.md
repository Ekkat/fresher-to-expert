# Learn the craft

In last two sections we concentrated on improving skills through reading other's code, books and blogs. Reading is great but not enough. Until you code and see the things yourself, it will not be completely understood.

In this section, I am going to answer one of the most common question asked by many freshers in software industry. "How the things I learnt in college relate to the real world problems?".

This section contains resource to build things from scratch. There will be books,courses and other resources which will make you build thigns in step by step manner.

These resources assume you know at least one computer programming language, know how to use cmd line, data structures and some basic knowledge of basics of algorithm. These resources take long time to master so take time and use them. If you use all of the resources in the chapter you will be more comfortable with your theoretical knowledge.
