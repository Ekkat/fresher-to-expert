# Building your own

Last chapter talks about building complete computer system. Though its a powerful enough course to teach you most of the pieces, you cannot use the software you built there in real world.

So in this section I am going to discuss about the softwares you can use for your daily usage. Here you are going to create few of the softwares that you use everyday like Operating system, compiler etc to get a feel how these things are built from scratch.

### Why build when it already exist

Most of the students want to build new shiny things. It's easy to understand the urge to create something that no one has ever created. Before creating a new software it is equally important to understand things that we use every day. Building your own version of tools makes you understand these tools intimately .


### Use what you create
People ask me how to improve their code quality. I say use what you create. It's the best way to improve. So the idea of creating our own language,compiler is not only for learning, instead it is to use those tools as your daily driver. That makes you understand how much hard it is to create a quality software and why you should make your code more readable.
