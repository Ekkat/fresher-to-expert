# Language

You may have studied different computer languages like C, C++ like circulum. You have used IDE, compiler, assembler to compile the source code to the machine code and run the program. Ever you wanted to create your own computer language? Then here is your opportunity.


#Why our own computer language
Computer lanugages are primary way we communicate to the computer. Different languages have different characterstics. When we study them in the beginnings they feel difficult to grasp. So we want to understand what it to take create a good enough language from scrath. Creating our own language gives us the better understanding of existing computer languages and also adds poweful tool to our toolkit when we solve problems

#Learning from the masters

The book you are going to use to learn the language is created by masters of the field. The book is written by  Brian W. Kernighan, creator of Unix, B language and Rob pike, one of the creator Go
language. Both created the software that endured many decades



#Book

[Unix programming environment](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software-Series/dp/013937681X) is the one you should refer. If you have read earlier chapters you know that the book is already refrenced in the Read section. But for learning to create langugage you have to concentrate on last chapter of the book name "Programming environment"

In this long chapter, authors shows how to create a C like programming language in under 3000 lines of C code. It's shows with right approach creating a programming language is not a big deal.

So go through this chapter from this book, by end of the chapter you know how to create your own language.
