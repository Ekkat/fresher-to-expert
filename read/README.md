# Read - Keep up with world
Textbooks become obsolete faster than you think. In a fast moving industry like us, technologies come and go in few years. So keeping up with latest trends and technologies is very important for a craft man.

#Opinionated World
Each programming language, each computing framework is an opinionated work. It's the opinion of the author to say this is exact way of solving the problem. Textbooks fool us by making us to think that whatever the tool author tells is the right way of doing things. But if you see the real world it's not true. So if you thought C/Java is the best language out there forget about it. There are better languages and concepts.

#Reading
People coming from the engineering background hate to read. The part of the problem is with the kind of books recommended for reading. The resources shared here are nowhere near the boring or useless.

#Habbit
Make a habit of reading everyday.
