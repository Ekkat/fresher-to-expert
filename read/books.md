# Books
Coming from the engineer background, I always hated reading textbooks. Most of the textbooks were dry and presented topics in not interesting way. But over the course my carrier I have found very interesting books which make you think in completely new direction.

As you now are getting up to date with world technology news its very important to read books. Books distill the best practices of craft and gives very depth the understanding of the topics.

The books presented are here like starting points to the interesting and fun programming books. After reading few of these, I hope you get interested in read more books which again will help you read more.

#What kind of books you should read?

Try to avoid the books which teaches you just syntax and semantics. Though syntax and semantics are important for the programming they may not be helpful in the longer. So I have given set of books that goes deeper into the programming.

You can get hard copy and e books of these from amazon. If you try hard you should be able to get downloadable pdf too.

#Programming Books you should start with

* ###Coders at Work

In every department of engineering, people learn about great people contributed to the field. In music, every one will learn about Beethoven, or tyagaraj in karnatic music. Sadly in our field, we hardly know about the those people. So let's start our reading list by knowing the great people in our field and understanding their contribution the computer science.

**Coder's at Work** is collection of interviews with Great programmers in the field. Going through these interviews make you familiar with how people learn programming and how they contributed overtime. It's gives you inspiration to become just more than a programmer.

* ###The C Programming language

Everyone starts learning programming with C programming language. This book not only teaches you the C programming language but it's also teaches you the art of programming. Even if you have read any other C programming books, I recommend you to go through this book and do the excelsiors . C will be never same again.


* ###Unix programming environment

Learning the operating system is cool. But what about learning the operating system from it's creator? Unix programming environment is written by creators of the UNIX operating system.

To read this book correctly, grab a Linux machine and practice it each and every aspect in that. You will learn more about operating system in one month than your six month operating system course.

Ever wondered how different softwares are written from scratch? . This is the book you should read to get answer. The book is 40 years old but still relevant today. Book gives in depth view of what it takes to build different kind of programs from scratch. Book includes the entire examples source code in C. So if you know C you should be able to pickup the book and learn the best software techniques.


# Additional programming books

The following are additional reads. If you are familiar with specific technologies pickup those books and run with it.

* ### Thinking in Java

This should the book you should read if you want to be fluent in Java. It not only goes in depth into the Java programming language it's also teaches how to Object oriented programming right.
