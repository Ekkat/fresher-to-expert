# Books
Coming from an engineering background, I always hated reading textbooks. Most of the textbooks were dry and presented topics were not interesting in any way. But over the course, in my career I  found few interesting books which changed my view on textbooks.

Books distill the best practices of craft and gives in depth understanding on the topics.So it's very important to read books.

The books presented are here like starting point/introduction to some of the interesting and fun programming books. After reading few of these, I hope you get interested to read more books which in turn will make you a better reader.

### What kind of books you should read?

Try to avoid the books which focuses on the syntax and semantics of the programming language. Though syntax and semantics are important for programming but they may not be helpful in the longer run. So I  avoid those kind of books and recommend only those set of books that goes deeper into the world of programming.

You can get hard copy or e-books of these books from amazon. If you try hard and are lucky enough you should be able to get downloadable pdf too!

### Programming Books to start with

* ####[Coders at Work](http://www.codersatwork.com/)

In every department of engineering, people learn about great people who contributed to the field. In music, every one will learn about Beethoven, Tyagaraj. Sadly in our field, we hardly know about the such people,so let's start our reading list by knowing the great people in our field and understanding their contribution to computer science.

**Coder's at Work** is a collection of interviews with Great programmers from various sections of computer science. Going through these interviews will make you familiar as how people learn programming and how they have contributed overtime. It will inspire you to become just more than a programmer.
