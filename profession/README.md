# Profession

The last five sections we talked extensively about various ways you can improve your knowledge and contribute to the world. This section we are concentrating on how you can take up software development as profession.

In this section, I have discussed about various opportunities for a software developer to pursue. This opportunities are specific to India, as I am more familiar with the place. You may find similar opportunities in your country too.

There are many criteria people use to choose a job. There is no single way to say one company is better than other company. So use this section information as a guidance rather than rule.

This section is written only to introduce readers to the different opportunities. I don't endorse any specific company or type of industry. You go through the opportunities and make up mind your own mind.
